### What's Aragon and what it allows
---

Aragon is a project to **empower freedom** by making **decentralized governance** happen.

We have built multiple pieces of infrastructure to make this happen:
- **aragonOS**: A framework that enables flexible and upgradeable governance mechanisms by creating and assigning permissions to multiple entities.
- **aragon.js**: A Javascript library to interact with aragonOS by handling transaction pathing, upgradeability and state of the contracts.
- **Aragon UI**: An Aragon-native toolkit of UI components for decentralized apps.
- **Aragon CLI**: Aragon CLI is a tool for creating, testing and publishing Aragon applications.
- **Aragon Core** ([try it out!](http://app.aragon.org)): A client to interact with aragonOS-powered decentralized organizations. It implements a signer with transaction pathing, notifications and a sandboxed environment for aragonOS-based apps using aragon.js.

Although these components are very powerful together, you can use them indivually.
We will explore how to do both.
