## What is Aragon and what does it do

---

Aragon is a project to **empower freedom** by creating tools for **decentralized governance**.

These tools help people freely organize **without borders or intermediaries**. Instead of bureaucracy, subjectivity, and trust, smart contracts have opened the door to **experiment with governance at the speed of software**.

The Aragon stack helps you develop software for **human organization**. From the smart contracts to the user interface, Aragon takes care of the most important pieces of infrastructure to deliver censorship-resistant, decentralized and upgradeable apps.

What you need to get started building with Aragon:

- [Environment setup](#environment-setup)
- [Quick start](#quick-start)
- [Next steps](#next-steps)


## Environment setup

### Node version

Make sure you have at least Node.js `v8.0.0`.

### Signing and web3 provider

We recommend using [Frame](https://frame.sh) to send transactions to the blockchain. Otherwise you can use [Metamask browser extension](https://metamask.io/).

### Install the aragonCLI

From the command line run:

```sh
npm i -g @aragon/cli
```

Once we have this package installed we can start building DAOs.

### Note on Git

You might need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed.

### Windows considerations

You might need to run the shell with administrator rights when installing the aragonCLI, because our `go-ipfs` dependency will need to create a symlink to work correctly.

If you have problems during the instalation of aragonCLI or any other dependencies. You probably need to install [windows-build-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools) or similar package.


## Quick start

To create your first DAO run:

```sh
npx create-aragon-app foo.aragonpm.eth
cd foo
npx aragon run
```

Congrats you have just created a DAO! It’s running on your local network and as soon as it's ready it will open in your browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

## Next steps

Now that you’ve built a DAO let's take a look at the docs or you can jump into the [tutorial](/docs/tutorial.html).
