### What's Aragon and what it allows
---

Aragon is a project to **empower freedom** by creating tools for **decentralized governance**.

These tools help people freely organize **without borders or intermediaries**. Instead of bureaucracy, subjectivity, and trust, smart contracts have opened the door to **experiment with governance at the speed of software**.

The Aragon stack helps you develop software for **human organization**. From the smart contracts to the user interface, Aragon takes care of the most important pieces of infrastructure to deliver censorship-resistant, decentralized and upgradeable apps.
