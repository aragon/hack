 
# Introduction

 The Agent app (or Aragon Agent) is an Aragon app that can be installed in any Aragon DAO. It's main feature is its ability to perform arbitrary calls to contracts. This means it can be thought of as the **external interface of a DAO**. 

 Put another way:

 >Aragon Agent is a fully-fledged Ethereum account owned by an Aragon organization. **It's like a multi-signature account on steroids that enables organizations to interact with any Ethereum contract or protocol.** Trading tokens on 0x or Uniswap, opening a Maker CDP, managing names in ENS, owning digital LAND parcels, or even breeding digital cats. [Source](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-agent-beta-release/)
 
 In technical terms, it's a superset of the [Vault app](https://wiki.aragon.org/dev/apps/vault/), which means it can hold valuable assets ((ETH and [ERC-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC-20) tokens).
 
Concretely, the Agent app allows for things like:

- An Aragon DAO to interact with other Ethereum smart contracts or protocols without the need to implement a custom Aragon app for every protocol.

- Members of DAOs to identify themselves as their DAO when using any Ethereum dApp.

- An Aragon DAO to participate as a stakeholder in another DAO.

# Setup

## 0. Create a Democracy DAO

Before we start, you'll need to head over to [Aragon](https://app.aragon.org/) and create a new DAO with the [democracy template](https://github.com/aragon/dao-kits/tree/master/kits/democracy).

If you're not sure how to do that, please have a look at  [this section](https://wiki.aragon.org/tutorials/Aragon_User_Guide/#21-create-a-new-democracy-organization) of our awesome [User Guide](https://wiki.aragon.org/tutorials/Aragon_User_Guide/#21-create-a-new-democracy-organization).

The first thing you'll be asked to do is to [choose the network](https://wiki.aragon.org/tutorials/Aragon_User_Guide/#211-navigate-to-httpsapparagonorg-in-your-web-browser) for your organization. For the purposes of this guide we'll choose the **Ethereum Testnet (Rinkeby)**.

Later on, you'll be asked to [set three parameters](https://wiki.aragon.org/tutorials/Aragon_User_Guide/#214-set-the-parameters-of-your-democracy-organization-then-click-next) for your organisation -- the **support**, the **minimum acceptance quorum**, and the **vote duration**.

We'll go with the following (sensible) defaults:

- Support: 100%
- Min. Quorum: 0%
- Duration: 168 hours (or 1 week)

## 1. Install aragonCLI

The [aragonCLI]((https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-intro).) (Command Line Interface) is what we use to create, interact with, and develop Aragon apps.

Install it from NPM by running the following command:

`npm install -g @aragon/cli`

Hopefully, it downloaded successfully üòä.

 If not, you should take a quick look at the [installing aragonCLI](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/guides-faq#installing-aragoncli) section of our [troubleshooting guide](/docs/guides-faq#installing-aragonCLI). It should help diagnose and fix the problem.
 
If that still doesn't fix things üòü, please reach out to us at the [#dev-help channel on the Aragon Chat](https://aragon.chat/channel/dev-help). We're more than happy to help.

Note that even if you've already installed the CLI, you might want to reinstall it to make sure you're up to date with the latest version.

## 2. Install the Agent app

Now that we've downloaded aragonCLI üéâ, we're ready to install the Agent app.

aragonCLI installs the `aragon dao` commands. We use [these commands](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-dao-commands) to interact directly with our DAO from the command line. They're also available directly using the `dao` shortcut.

We'll use the the [`dao install`](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-dao-commands#dao-install) command to install the Agent app.

`dao install` takes two arguments:

1. The address or name of an Aragon DAO. 
2. The name of an Aragon app.

So to install the Agent app run: 

`dao install <your organisation's name> agent --environment aragon:rinkeby --apm.ipfs.rpc https://ipfs.eth.aragon.network/ipfs/` 

You should see that after `dao install <your organisation's name> agent` we pass in two [global options](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-intro#global-options): `--enviroment` and `--apm.ipfs.rpc`.

The `--environment` option allows us to specify the network we want to use. In our case we've created our organization on rinkeby so we pass in `aragon:rinkeby`.

Note that if we had chosen the **Ethereum Mainnet** as the network for our organization we would have passed `aragon:mainnet` instead of `aragon:rinkeby` as the argument to `--environment`.

The `--apm.ipfs.rpc` option allows us to point to an IPFS node that has the files we are looking for. In our case we're pointing it to the aragon network IPFS node.

Note that we can run our own IPFS node by running `aragon ipfs` in another terminal window. 

Running a local IPFS node allows us to run the same command without the `--apm.ipfs.rpc` option (since the `--apm.ipfs.rpc` option defaults to `http://localhost:5001`). 

However, since IPFS propogation is slow, it's better to point directly to the aragon IPFS node.

**Note that this will trigger a vote in the DAO, you'll need to vote *yes* to confirm the installation of the Agent app.**


## 3. Set permissions

If you look at the end of the output of the `dao install` command you just ran, you should see the following:
```
‚Ñπ Successfully executed: "Execute desired action as a token holder"
 ‚ö† After the app instance is created, you will need to assign permissions to it for it appear as an app in the DAO
```
What does this mean exactly 
üòï? 

It's telling us that although we've successfully installed the Agent app, before we can use it as part of our DAO we need to define who can access the app's functionality.

In other words, we need to define who (or which app) has permission to execute actions in the Agent app and who can re-grant and revoke that permission.

In this guide we're going to give the Voting app permissions to execute actions on behalf of the Agent app, and therefore on behalf of the DAO.

To assign these permissions we need to get a hold of the Ethereum address of the Agent app -- remember **Agent is a fully-fledged Ethereum account** -- as well as the address of the Voting app.

To do this we'll use the [`dao apps`](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-dao-commands#dao-apps) command.

`dao apps` takes one argument: the address or name of an aragon DAO. 

By default it only returns apps with permissions. But we can use the `--all` option to get it to return apps without permissions in the report.

From the command line run:

`dao apps <your organization name> --all --environment aragon:rinkeby`

You should see a table that looks something like this:

| App  | Proxy address | Content |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| kernel@vundefined  | 0xa25fb31870bc492d450012ae32dafa72af9e82c3  | (No UI available) |
| acl@vundefined | 0xfefb0cdb7a1fac257815d52ba82776f98dc70205   | (No UI available) |
| evmreg@vundefined | 0x9087db02300ef24b116daf0426b6ba22b28a0c79  | (No UI available) | 
| voting@v2.0.4 | **0x15a102f80ea3b1bd585a044e9b3c39a84c5f44e5**  | ipfs:QmPjWU51opgTVnXwAhYAWasL2CaiYHqy2mXdXtzqfC8sKx |
| vault@v3.0.1   | 0x952a18185da912984e0bc8a830ba98f8151976af | ipfs:QmeMabCnkA5BtTTszqqRztYKCXZqE9VQFH4Vx7dY9ue2nA |
| finance@v2.0.5    | 0x4171f7ac1a4606b93093e8648e2f9a16c59cf3b1 | ipfs:QmeMLs4jHya89khHVSubLaao9cZW6ELZUoYPHkwCUwKBH7 |
| token-manager@v2.0.3  | 0xbf07e1c74a72aa60df3ddf3115d15575d27e61e1 | ipfs:Qmb9Bv3J9AuXD5auY1WNwiJeohnYRhyso7XMULs7EZ8eTG |

Followed directly by another that looks like this:

| Permissionless app   | Proxy address  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0x9ac98dc5f995bf0211ed589ef022719d1487e5cb2bab505676f0d084c07cf89a | **0x843bfA21a040E742ec32b8F6991e182D9655AF21** |

The permissionless app is the Agent app we've just installed. Its address is listed under **Proxy address** in the bottom table. In my case that's **0x843bfA21a040E742ec32b8F6991e182D9655AF21** .

The Voting app address can be found under the **Proxy address** column in the voting app row of the first table: **0x15a102f80ea3b1bd585a044e9b3c39a84c5f44e5** .

Once you've located your Agent and Voting app addresses, run the following command:

`dao acl create <Your organisation name> <Your agent app address> EXECUTE_ROLE <Your voting app address> <Your voting app address> --environment aragon:rinkeby`

You should see the following output:

```
‚úî Generating transaction
  ‚úî Sending transaction
 ‚úî Successfully executed
```
If you've reached this stage, üòäüéâ Congratulations! üéâüòä You've successfully given your Voting app permissions to execute actions on behalf of your Agent app!

Why did that work üòï?

Before we explain the `dao acl create` command we ran above we need to understand a little bit about how permissions in Aragon work.

Aragon uses an [Access Control List](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/acl-intro) (ACL) to control who can access your app's functionality.

This list contains a set of who has permission to execute an action in an Aragon app and who can re-grant or revoke that permission.

[`dao acl create`](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-dao-commands#dao-acl-create) is just the Aragon command used to create a permission in the ACL.

It takes 5 arguments:

**1.** The name or main address of the DAO

**2.** The address of the app whose permissions are being managed.

**3.** The identifier or name of the role.

**4.** The address of the app (or entity) that is being granted the permission.

**5.** The address of the app (or entity) that will be able to grant that permission or revoke it.

Let's revisit an annotated version of the command we ran above:

```
dao acl create
1. <Your organization name>
2. <Your agent app address> 
3. EXECUTE_ROLE
4. <Your voting app address>
5. <Your voting app address>
--environment aragon:rinkeby
```
You should see that in our case:

**1.** Is the name of our organization. 

**2.** Is our organization's Agent app -- we are managing the permissions of our Agent app by allowing the Voting app to execute actions on behalf of it).

**3.** Is the EXECUTE_ROLE. The EXECUTE_ROLE is a role defined in the Agent app. It allows an app or entity to transfer tokens (as well as some additional actions).

**4.** Is our organization's Voting app -- we are granting permission to our Voting app to execute actions on behalf of our Agent app.

**5.** Is our Voting app again. We are giving it permission to re-grant or revoke the permission we have just given it.

For more on how we handle permissions in Aragon, we encourage you to read through this [documentation](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/acl-intro).

**Note that, same as before, this will trigger a vote in the DAO, you'll need to vote *yes* to confirm the new permissions you've granted to the Voting app.**

## 4. Check the app has appeared

If you rerun the command:

`dao apps <your organization name> --all --environment aragon:rinkeby`

You should see that your Agent app has been added to the bottom of the App table and that the Permissionless app table is now empty.

| App  | Proxy address | Content |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| kernel@vundefined  | 0xa25fb31870bc492d450012ae32dafa72af9e82c3 | (No UI available) |
| acl@vundefined | 0xfefb0cdb7a1fac257815d52ba82776f98dc70205 | (No UI available) |
| evmreg@vundefined | 0x9087db02300ef24b116daf0426b6ba22b28a0c79 | (No UI available) | 
| voting@v2.0.4 | 0x15a102f80ea3b1bd585a044e9b3c39a84c5f44e5 | ipfs:QmPjWU51opgTVnXwAhYAWasL2CaiYHqy2mXdXtzqfC8sKx |
| vault@v3.0.1   | 0x952a18185da912984e0bc8a830ba98f8151976af | ipfs:QmeMabCnkA5BtTTszqqRztYKCXZqE9VQFH4Vx7dY9ue2nA |
| finance@v2.0.5    | 0x4171f7ac1a4606b93093e8648e2f9a16c59cf3b1 | ipfs:QmeMLs4jHya89khHVSubLaao9cZW6ELZUoYPHkwCUwKBH7 |
| token-manager@v2.0.3  | 0xbf07e1c74a72aa60df3ddf3115d15575d27e61e1 | ipfs:Qmb9Bv3J9AuXD5auY1WNwiJeohnYRhyso7XMULs7EZ8eTG |
| **0x9ac98dc5f995bf0211ed589ef022719d1487e5cb2bab505676f0d084c07cf89a** | 0x843bfa21a040e742ec32b8f6991e182d9655af21 | ipfs:QmfNaBuQsaKE8at2ce9k2FU9dKs16WQqg4RPUHSNik1z9e |


| Permissionless app   | Proxy address  |
| ------------- | ------------- |

This confirms that the Agent app has been assigned permissions and is now an app in the DAO.

Note that **0x9ac98dc5f995bf0211ed589ef022719d1487e5cb2bab505676f0d084c07cf89a** is just the identifier for the Agent app.

# Use cases

## A. Voting in another organization

### **1. Create another Democracy DAO**

Exactly the same as before, revisit step 0 of the Setup section above if you've forgotten üòã. **[link]**

### **2. Mint a token to allow our first DAO (A) to vote in our new DAO (B)**

We've now created two Democracy DAOs -- let's call them **A** and **B**. **A** has an Agent app, **B** doesn't. We want to allow **A** to vote in **B**.

Remember that one needs to be a tokenholder of **B** to be able to vote in **B**. And that **A**'s Agent app acts its external interface.  

In other words, **A**'s Agent app allows it to participate as a stakeholder in **B**.

It follows that to allow **A** to vote in **B** we need to mint a token for **A**'s Agent app in **B**. We do this by interacting with **B**'s Token Manager app.

```
dao exec <name of dao B> <token manager app address of dao B> mint <agent app address of dao A> 1000000000000000000 --environment aragon:rinkeby --apm.ipfs.rpc https://ipfs.eth.aragon.network/ipfs/
```

Remember you can run `dao apps <organization name> --environment aragon:rinkeby` to find the address of the apps in any of your DAOs.

Note that running `dao exec` will trigger a vote in **B**: you'll need to vote *yes* to confirm the minting of the token.

**Things to mention/explain:**
- 1000000000000000000
- aragon ipfs
- dao exec
- mint function
- token manager
- UI workflow

### **3. Create a vote in B to add a third member**

*Insert visual explanation (UI)* 

### **4. Use A's Agent app to take part in B's vote**
```
dao act <agent app address of dao A> <voting app address of dao B>  "vote" 2 true true  --environment aragon:rinkeby
```

### **5. Confirm the vote/action in A**
```
dao exec <name of dao A> <voting app address of dao A> "vote" 2 true true --environment aragon:rinkeby --apm.ipfs.rpc https://ipfs.eth.aragon.network/ipfs/
```

## B. Opening a makerCDP

## C. Interacting with Uniswap

## D. Creating an Aragon Trust
