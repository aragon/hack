The aragonCLI (Command Line Interface) is used to create and develop Aragon apps.

## Install

The aragonCLI can be installed directly from NPM:

```
npm install -g @aragon/cli
```

It can also be installed directly from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli.git
cd packages/aragon-cli
npm install
npm link
```

After installing, the main `aragon` executable will be available for use. It will also install the `dao` alias which is a shortcut for `aragon dao` commands.
