### The Aragon CLI is used to create and develop Aragon apps
---

## Install

The Aragon CLI can be installed directly from NPM, which will download the newest version.

```console
npm install -g @aragon/cli
```

It can also be installed directly from source:

```console
git clone https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli.git
cd aragon-cli
npm install 
npm link
```

After installing, the main `aragon` executable will be available for use. It will also install the `dao` alias which is a shortcut for `aragon dao` commands.

## Main commands

### `aragon init`

The `init` command will set up an Aragon app project so you can start building your app from a functional boilerplate.

```console
aragon init [app-name] [boilerplate]
```

- `app-name`: The name or ENS domain name for your app in an APM Registry (e.g. `myapp` or `myapp.aragonpm.eth`). If only the name is provided, by default it will create your app on the default `aragonpm.eth` registry.

- `boilerplate`: the Github repo name or alias for a boilerplate to set up your app. The currently available boilerplates are:

	- `react`: this boilerplate contains a very basic Counter app and a webapp for interacting with it. If using React for building your app's frontend using this boilerplate is the best option, as it showcases the end-to-end interaction with an Aragon app, from the contracts to the webapp.
	- `react-kit`: it is a variation of the `react` boilerplate, but also comes with a DAO Kit which will allow for using your app interacting with other Aragon apps like the Voting app. You can read more about DAO Kits [here](kits-intro.md).
	- `bare`: this boilerplate will just set up your app directory structure, but contains no functional code.

### `aragon run`

The `run` command takes care of completely setting up the environment needed for running your Aragon app. These are all the things that running `aragon run` will do for you:

- It checks whether **IPFS** and a local **Ethereum development chain** (devchain) are running, and if not it will start them. If `aragon run` started a devchain or IPFS, when it is stopped, they will both be stopped too.
- It will **publish your app** to the local APM registry running in your devchain. Every time `aragon run` is executed, it will automatically publish a major update to the APM repo of your app. This step executes the `aragon apm publish` internally, you can check the options and how the command works in depth [here](#aragon-apm-publish).
- Once the package is published, it will **create a DAO** with your app installed. If you are running your app without a Kit, it will grant permissions to the first account (address and private key printed in the console) to perform all the actions protected with by the ACL in your app.
- After the DAO is created, it will download the [Aragon Core](https://github.com/aragon/aragon) client, install its dependencies and start it up so you can interact with your DAO.

Some available options to customize the `run` command:

- `--reset`: If reset is present, it will reset the devchain before running. The chain will then start from scratch and all published packages will need to be recreated.
- `--port`: The port where the devchain will be started.
- `--kit`: The name of the contract that will be deployed as the [DAO kit](kits-intro.md) that will be used to create your DAO. If no Kit is provided, it will use a default Kit that sets up the DAO with just your app.
- `--kit-init [argument1 ... argumentN]`: The constructor arguments for the Kit contract, separated by a space. See the [deploy command](#aragon-deploy) for more information on constructor arguments.
- `--build-script`: The name of the NPM script in your app that will be used for building the webapp.
- `--client [true|false]`: Can be used to disable starting the Aragon Core client. Defaults to `true`.

### `aragon devchain`

The `devchain` command is used for starting a local development testnet with all the required components already deployed and ready to use. It uses [aragen](https://github.com/aragon/aragen) for setting up the snapshot from which the chain starts. At any point, `aragon devchain --reset` can be run which will reset the devchain to the original snapshot.

This snapshot contains a local instance of ENS, that is used an APM registry (`aragonpm.eth`) and [aragon-id](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-id) (`aragonid.eth`), the first-party [Aragon apps](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps) published to APM (e.g. `voting.aragonpm.eth` or `token-manager.aragonpm.eth`) and the first-party [DAO Kits](https://github.com/aragon/dao-kits) (e.g. `bare-kit.aragonpm.eth`)

Devchains started on different ports keep their own state of the chain in parallel. This can be used to have two chains at different states. Therefore when starting a devchain at a different port, the chain will start from the snapshot.

Options:
- `--reset`: Resets the devchain to the snapshot.
- `--port`: The port number where the devchain will be started.

### `aragon ipfs`

The `ipfs` command is used to start an IPFS daemon, and it adds some files that are needed for the first-party Aragon apps to work.

### `aragon deploy`

The `deploy` command can be used for deploying an Ethereum contract to the devchain.

```console
aragon deploy [contract-name] [--init argument1 ... argumentN]
```

Running `aragon deploy` will compile your contracts using `truffle compile` and then will deploy the contract with the constructor arguments provided.

The `--init` arguments need to be separated by a space, and they will be passed to the contract constructor on deploy. The `@ARAGON_ENS` alias can be used and it will be replaced by the address of the ENS registry in the devchain.

## DAO commands

The `aragon dao` commands can be used for interacting with your DAO directly from the command line. These commands are also available directly using the `dao` alias.

### `dao new`

Uses a DAO Kit to create a new DAO and prints its address.

Options:
- `--kit`: The APM repo name of the kit that is used to create the DAO. Defaults to `bare-kit.aragonpm.eth`.
- `--kit-version [version-number|latest]`: The version of the repo that will be used to create the DAO. Defaults to `latest`.
- `--fn`: The function on the kit that is called to create a new DAO. Defaults to the `newBareInstance` function for `bare-kit.aragonpm.eth`.
- `--fn-args`: The arguments that the function to create the kit is called with. Defaults to an array of arguments.
- `--deploy-event`: The name of the event that is emitted when the DAO is created. The DAO address must be a return argument in the event log named `dao`. Defaults to `DeployInstance`.

### `dao upgrade`

The `dao upgrade` command upgrades all instances of an app to a newer version.

```console
dao upgrade [dao-addr] [app-apm-repo] [repo-version]
```

aragonOS protects against having different instances of a particular app running with different versions (e.g. all the Voting app instances run the same version), so performing a `dao upgrade` will upgrade all instances of the app to the version specified.

### `dao install`

The `dao install` command installs an instance of an app in the DAO.

```console
dao install [dao-addr] [app-apm-repo] [repo-version]
```

In aragonOS, an app is considered to be installed in a DAO if it uses the DAO Kernel as its Kernel and there are references to the app in the ACL of the DAO. 

The `dao install` command will create an instance of the app and assign permissions to the main account to perform all the protected actions in the app.

As explained in the [upgrade command](#dao-upgrade), all app instances of the same app in DAO must run the same version, so installing an app with a version will effectively upgrade all app instances to this version.

### dao apps

```console
dao apps [dao-addr]
```

Used to inspect all the installed apps in a DAO.

### dao acl


```console
dao acl [dao-addr]
```

Used to inspect the ACL state in a DAO to check its permissions.

## APM commands

### `aragon apm version`

```console
aragon apm version [patch|minor|major]
```

The `aragon apm version` command bumps the version number in the `arapp.json` file. If you modified the contracts, then you need to do a major upgrade or publishing will fail.

### `aragon apm versions`

The `aragon apm versions` command shows all the previously published versions of this package.

### `aragon apm publish`

The `aragon apm publish` command takes care of publishing a new version to the APM repo.

```console
aragon apm publish [contract-address|contract-name]
```

If a major version is being published, the contract address for your app has to be provided or the contract name so the contract can be deployed. If it is not provided, it will default to the contract specified in the `arapp.json` file.

If a minor or patch version is being published, then the command can be run with the `--only-content` flag, which will just perform an update to the content of the app (the webapp and its artifacts).

The command allows some parametrization:

- `--only-content`: For minor and patch upgrades, avoids deploying contract
- `--provider`: The provider where the files of the package will be published to. Defaults to `ipfs`.
- `--files`: The path to the files that will be published. Defaults to the current directory.
- `--ignore`: A gitignore pattern of files to ignore. Specify multiple times to add multiple patterns. Defaults to just the `node_modules` directory.
- `--publish-dir`: The path to the directory where all the files and generated artifacts will be copied to before publishing. If it is not specified, it will create a temporary directory.
- `--build [true|false]`: A flag to specify whether the webapp should be build while publishing. Defaults to `true`.
- `--build-script`: The name of the NPM script in your app that will be used for building the webapp.

## Global configuration

### The `arapp.json` file

The `arapp.json` file contains some metadata for your app. You can check an [example `arapp.json`](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/blob/master/apps/voting/arapp.json) file to see what fields need to be present.

- `appName`: The ENS name of your app where the APM repo can be located.
- `version`: The current version of the app.
- `path`: The path to the main contract in your app.
- `roles`: An array of all the roles that your app has. Each role has the following properties:
  - `id`: The identifier of the role as it is defined in the contract.
  - `name`: A description of the role in the app
  - `params`: In case the role can be parametrized, the names of the parameters.

## Troubleshooting/FAQ

### Resetting the devchain

After upgrading the CLI, or if unexpected errors are being experienced, [resetting the devchain](#aragon-devchain) (by doing `aragon devchain --reset` or `aragon run --reset`) is sometimes useful as it will restart the chain from the snapshot.

If you previously used `aragon apm publish`, you will likely need to reset the version of your app in its [`arapp.json`](#the-arappjson-file) file.

### Using Metamask

The easiets way to interact with your DAO is using [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). In order to do so, you must make sure that:

- It's unlocked
- Private network (_Localhost 8545_) is chosen
- The first account provided by `aragon run` or `aragon devchain` is imported and selected. To import the account, copy the private key (something like `a8a54b2d8197bc0b19bb8a084031be71835580a01e70a45a13babd16c9bc1563`), go to the accounts upper icon, to the left of the hamburguer button, scroll down, click on `Import account` and paste the value you copied.

### Issues sending transactions

Because of the way that Metamask caches the account nonces for the different networks, you may be getting the following error when interacting with your app:

```
Error: the tx doesn't have the correct nonce. account has nonce of: 157 tx has nonce of: 158
```

The workaround is to switch to a different network (e.g. Rinkeby) and then switch back to the _Localhost 8545_ network, this will refresh Metamask's account nonce cache. Sending transactions should now succeed.

### The `~/.aragon` directory

The Aragon CLI creates the `.aragon` directory under the user directory where it saves the state of the devchain and the Aragon Core client. 

In case the client is not loading properly, deleting the `~/.aragon` directory will make `aragon run` recreate the environment the next time it is used and may solve the issue.
