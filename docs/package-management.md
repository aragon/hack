### Publishing and upgrading Aragon apps
---

To ease upgrades for Aragon apps, both app **smart contracts and frontend can be upgraded using the Aragon Package Manager**.

The Aragon Package Manager (APM) is a DAO built on top of aragonOS (taking advantage of upgradeability and the ACL).

APM allows for multiple package registries to exist with different governance models for package publishing and releasing new versions. There is an official Aragon curated APM, `aragonpm.eth`, which has very strict restrictions of what gets published and very high quality standards that we use for publishing our core components.

Different APM registries in which everyone can publish their packages are expected to be created by the community. **You can create your own registry** and have full control over it.
