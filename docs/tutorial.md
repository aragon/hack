In this guide, we will walk you through creating your first Aragon app using [aragonOS](os-intro.md), the JavaScript implementation of [aragonAPI](js-intro.md), [aragonUI](ui-intro.md) and [aragonCLI](/docs/cli-intro.html).

## The setup

Let's first set up and bootstrap our project:

```sh
npx create-aragon-app foo.aragonpm.eth tutorial
```

This will create a new directory named `foo`, with files cloned from [your first Aragon app template](https://github.com/aragon/your-first-aragon-app). This particular boilerplate includes everything you need to get started — Truffle, aragonOS and aragonAPI.

Notice that we input a fully qualified [ENS](https://ens.domains/) name. Let's examine the ENS name we entered, because it is not entirely arbitrary.

![Illustration of foo.aragonpm.eth](https://i.imgur.com/MQnYT6d.png)

The first label in the ENS name is the name of our app. This can be anything you want, given that the full ENS name is not taken.

The second and third label is the name of the [aragonPM](package-management.md) (aragonPM) registry that your repository will be (or is) registered to. For the sake of simplicity, this guide assumes that you have rights to create repositories on aragonpm.eth, but you could deploy your own aragonPM registry if you so desire.

## Writing a simple contract

To illustrate how easy it is to use aragonOS, we will build our app as a vanilla smart contract, without any Aragon-specific interfaces at all.

Today, we will build a simple counter app — you can increment it, you can decrement it, and it will all be decentralized. Decentralized coffee counter, anyone?

```solidity
// contracts/CounterApp.sol
pragma solidity 0.4.24;

contract CounterApp {
    // Events
    event Increment(address entity);
    event Decrement(address entity);

    // State
    int public value;

    function increment() external {
        value += 1;
        emit Increment(msg.sender);
    }

    function decrement() external {
        value -= 1;
        emit Decrement(msg.sender);
    }
}
```

Pretty simple, right? You might wonder why we would bother adding events to this smart contract, but it comes in handy later for illustration purposes — and we can also create an activity feed from it, if we wanted to.

## 3 steps to governance and upgradeability

Now for the interesting part: making our simple smart contract an Aragon app.

First, inherit from the Aragon app smart contract, like so:

```solidity
import "@aragon/os/contracts/apps/AragonApp.sol";

contract CounterApp is AragonApp {
    // ...
}
```

Second, define the roles that you want your app to have. A role can be assigned to other apps or people and those entities will have access to methods guarded by that role.

In this example we will define a role for incrementing and a role for decrementing but note that you can have a single role to guard all methods in your contract if you find that appropriate.

```solidity
contract CounterApp is AragonApp {
    // ...
    bytes32 constant public INCREMENT_ROLE = keccak256("INCREMENT_ROLE");
    bytes32 constant public DECREMENT_ROLE = keccak256("DECREMENT_ROLE");
    // ...
}
```

Finally, guard the methods with the `auth()` modifier that the `AragonApp` interface gives you and add an [initialize function](/docs/aragonos-building.html#constructor-and-initialization) to your contract:

```solidity
contract CounterApp is AragonApp {
    // ...

    function initialize() onlyInit public {
        initialized();
    }

    function increment() auth(INCREMENT_ROLE) external {
        // ...
    }

    function decrement() auth(DECREMENT_ROLE) external {
        // ...
    }
}
```

That's it. In 3 steps, you now have an Aragon app, with full upgradeability and modular governance.

## Descriptive transactions

Aragon wants to be as user friendly as possible, so it provides an easy way for developers to describe what their smart contracts do in a human readable way. It's called [Radspec](human-readable-txs.md). It works by putting `@notice` statements alongside a human readable description for the function.

```solidity
contract CounterApp is AragonApp {
    /**
     * @notice Increment the counter by 1
     */
    function increment() auth(INCREMENT_ROLE) external {
        // ...
    }

    /**
     * @notice Decrement the counter by 1
     */
    function decrement() auth(DECREMENT_ROLE) external {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Building the frontend

Because apps inside the [Aragon client](client.md) are sandboxed, it also means that apps do not have direct access to Web3.

Apps are run inside an iframe, which means that it only has access to its own DOM, not the outlying DOM. The app can communicate with the client over our own custom RPC protocol.

Then the client takes care of connecting to Ethereum via Web3, and also handles things like signing transactions, displaying notifications and more to the end-user.

All of this is achieved by using aragonAPI. aragonAPI is split in two parts: one for clients and one for apps. The client portion of aragonAPI reads _requests_ from the app over RPC, sandboxes apps and performs Web3 actions, whereas the app portion provides a simple API to communicate with the client (to read state, send transactions and more).

Because we're building an app, all we need is `@aragon/client` and our template already has that installed.

### Background workers and building state

Apps usually want to listen to events using Web3 and build an application state from those events. This concept is also known as _event sourcing_.

aragonAPI was built with event sourcing in mind. To build state continually without having the app loaded indefinitely, though, we need to run a background script.

Thankfully the [Aragon client](client.md) will run background scripts specified in the manifest files of our app (more on manifest files later).

Let's start by writing a background worker that listens for our `Increment` and `Decrement` events, and builds a state that simply is the current value of our counter.

```js
// app/script.js
import '@babel/polyfill'
import Aragon from '@aragon/client'

const app = new Aragon()

const initialState = {
  count: 0,
}
app.store(async (state, event) => {
  if (state === null) state = initialState

  switch (event.event) {
    case 'Increment':
      return { count: await getValue() }
    case 'Decrement':
      return { count: await getValue() }
    default:
      return state
  }
})

function getValue() {
  // Get current value from the contract by calling the public getter
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    app
      .call('value')
      .first()
      .map(value => parseInt(value, 10))
      .subscribe(resolve)
  })
}
```

If you've worked with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) before, this might look vaguely familiar.

The `store` method takes in a reducer function with the signature `(state, event) => state`, where `state` is whatever you want it to be (in this example it is an integer), and `event` is a [Web3 event](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth-contract.html#contract-events).

Internally, `store` will fetch the last known state (if any) and pass that in as the first argument, and then store the resulting state in cache. This state can be observed in the view portion of your app. Also note that the `store` method returns an observable of states. This is a recurring theme in the JavaScript implementation of aragonAPI—almost everything is an [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/) observable.

The reducer function **must always** return a state, even if it is the same state as before.

> **Note**<br>
> The state will start out as `null`, not `undefined` because of the JSONRPC specification.

### Displaying State

Now let's write the view portion of our app. In our case, this is a simple HTML file, and a simple JavaScript file that observes the state that our background worker builds for us.

```html
<!-- app/index.html !-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Counter App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button id="decrement">-</button>
    <div id="view">...</div>
    <button id="increment">+</button>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

```js
// app/app.js
import Aragon, { providers } from '@aragon/client'

const initializeApp = () => {
  const app = new Aragon(new providers.WindowMessage(window.parent))

  const view = document.getElementById('view')

  app.state().subscribe(
    state => {
      // the state is null in the beginning, when there are no event emitted from the contract
      view.innerHTML = `The counter is ${state ? state.count : 0}`
    },
    err => {
      view.innerHTML = 'An error occured, check the console'
      console.log(err)
    }
  )
}

const sendMessageToWrapper = (name, value) => {
  window.parent.postMessage({ from: 'app', name, value }, '*')
}

// handshake between Aragon Core and the iframe,
// since iframes can lose messages that were sent before they were ready
window.addEventListener('message', ({ data }) => {
  if (data.from !== 'wrapper') {
    return
  }
  if (data.name === 'ready') {
    sendMessageToWrapper('ready', true)
    initializeApp()
  }
})
```

That's it! Internally, `state` observes the `state` key in cache and emits every time a change occurs.

### Sending transactions

Our users need to be able to increment and decrement the counter. For this, we publish what is called an _intent_ to the wrapper.

An intent is an action you would like to occur on a specific contract. This intent is handled by the client, which will calculate a _transaction path_ using the ACL of our DAO.

To understand transaction paths, we must first understand a little bit about how the ACL works.

The [ACL (Access Control List)](acl-intro.md) is a simple mapping of _who_ can perform _what_ actions _where_. In our case, _someone_ can perform an action guarded by a specific role (the _what_) on our app (the _where_).

However, it is entirely possible that users can not perform actions directly. For example, in order to increment the counter, we might want a decision making process, such as a vote. The beauty of aragonOS is that we never need to specify this directly, as this is handled by the ACL.

We simply say that the only one (_who_) that can perform increments and decrements (_what_) on our app (_where_) is the voting app. This is not done at compile time, it is done at run time.

This works because of a concept called [_forwarders_](forwarding-intro.md). A forwarder is simply an app that can execute transactions on someone's behalf, if the ACL permits it, and that app can have its own _arbitrary conditions_ under which it wants to execute your transaction! In the example of the voting app, the voting app will only execute your transaction if the vote passes.

It's really simple to use. Let's add our intents to our app:

```js
// app/app.js
const initializeApp = () => {
  // ...
  const increment = document.getElementById('increment')
  const decrement = document.getElementById('decrement')

  increment.onclick = () => {
    app.increment()
  }
  decrement.onclick = () => {
    app.decrement()
  }
  // ...
}
```

That's it! Now whenever the user clicks one of either the increment or decrement buttons, an intent is sent to the wrapper, and it will show the user a transaction to sign.

### The build script

Since we're importing Node.js modules in our front-end, we need a build script. For this, we opted to use `parcel` because it has zero config, but you can use your favorite bundler.

Let's add the build script to `package.json`:

```json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "parcel build app/script.js -d dist/ && parcel build app/index.html -d dist/ --public-url \".\""
  }
  // ...
}
```

You can now build the front-end of your app by running `npm run build`.

## Writing the manifest files

In order for aragonAPI to function, it needs some metadata about your app. This metadata is specified in two manifest files; `manifest.json` and `arapp.json`.

`arapp.json` defines smart contract and aragonPM-specific things like the roles in your app or different environments.

Let's modify `arapp.json` so that it knows about the roles we defined previously and use the development environment:

```json
{
  "roles": [
    {
      "name": "Increment the counter",
      "id": "INCREMENT_ROLE",
      "params": []
    },
    {
      "name": "Decrement the counter",
      "id": "DECREMENT_ROLE",
      "params": []
    }
  ],
  "environments": {
    "default": {
      "network": "development",
      "appName": "foo.aragonpm.eth"
    }
  },
  "path": "contracts/CounterApp.sol"
}
```

`manifest.json` defines end-user specific things like the human-readable name of your app, icons, and a small description of your app. It also (optionally) defines background scripts, of which we have one.

Let's modify it accordingly:

```json
{
  "name": "Counter",
  "description": "My first Aragon app",
  "script": "/dist/script.js",
  "start_url": "/dist/index.html"
}
```

## Running your app locally

To test out your app without deploying a DAO yourself, installing apps, setting up permissions and setting up aragonPM, you can simply run:

```sh
npx aragon run
```

This will do a couple of things for you:

- It will start a development chain you can interact with (it uses `ganache-core`, so it's a full testrpc instance)
- It deploys an Aragon DAO with apps and development permissions (i.e. everyone can do everything)
- It publishes your app to a local aragonPM instance
- It installs your app

After running this command a browser tab should pop up with your freshly created DAO, complete with permissions and your local app installed.

> **Note**<br>
> It's not pretty, but it works. To see a more beautiful version of our counter app, check out the example app that is included in the [React template](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-react-boilerplate)!

### Running your app from an HTTP server

Running your app using HTTP will allow for a faster development process of your app's front-end, as it can be hot-reloaded without the need to execute `aragon run` every time a change is made.

Let's add the scripts we need to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start:app": "npm run build -- --no-minify && parcel serve app/index.html -p 8001 --out-dir dist/ --no-cache",
    "start:aragon:http": "npx aragon run --http localhost:8001 --http-served-from ./dist"
  }
}
```

- First start your app's development server running `npm run start:app`, and keep that process running. By default it will rebuild the app and reload the server when changes to the source are made.

- After that, you can run `npm run start:aragon:http` which will compile your app's contracts, publish the app locally and create a DAO. You will need to stop it and run it again after making changes to your smart contracts.

> **Note**<br>
> Changes to the app's background script (`app/script.js`) cannot be hot-reloaded, after making changes to the script, you will need to either restart the development server (`npm run start:app`) or rebuild the script `npm run build`.

## Next steps

### Publishing

Now that we're confident that our app will work and amaze the world, we should publish it. You can follow the publish guide to learn [how to publish in different environments](guides-publish.md).

### More CLI commands

You can check the [aragonCLI documentation](cli-main-commands.md) for an in-depth description of how all the commands available in the CLI work.

### Documentation

A good place to go from here would be to check out [our existing apps](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps). They are fairly self-contained and use some patterns you might find helpful.

There is much more to [aragonOS](os-intro.md) and [aragonAPI](ui-intro.md), and we even have our own [UI toolkit](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-ui). We encourage you to explore all 3 and provide us feedback.

### Community

Join the conversation and ask questions on [GitHub](https://github.com/aragon), [Aragon Forum](https://forum.aragon.org) and [Aragon Chat](https://aragon.chat), and make sure to tell us if you build something ara-mazing!
