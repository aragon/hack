This guide will show you how to publish your app in different environments.

## Setup

We'll start from the [React boilerplate](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-react-boilerplate).

```sh
npx create-aragon-app publish react
```

This will create a new directory named `publish`, with everything you need.

## Introduction to environments

This app has 3 environments defined in `arapp.json`:

| Environment   | Network   |
|---            |---        |
| default       | localhost |
| staging       | rinkeby   |
| production    | mainnet   |

Is a prerequisite to have a ENS Registry address defined. 

Environments are defined in `arapp.json`, for example `staging` points to:
- an ENS registry: `0x314159265dd8dbb310642f98f50c066173c1259b`
- an APM registry: `open.aragonpm.eth`
- an APM repository: `app`
- an Ethereum network: `rinkeby`
- an Ethereum websockets provider: `wss://rinkeby.eth.aragon.network/ws` - to **read** from the blockchain

The `rinkeby` network is further defined in `truffle.js`, an has an Ethereum provider (to **write** to the blockchain), which define:
- an address: `https://rinkeby.infura.io`
- an Ethereum account: `0xb41...6eE7` (which is the first account generated from the `DEFAULT_MNEMONIC` variable, to use a different account see the [troubleshooting guide](/docs/guides-faq.html/set-a-private-key)

## Major version: content + contract

Command:

```sh
npm run publish:major --environment staging
```

This will:
1. _build_ the app's frontend (the output lives in `dist`)
2. _compile_ the app's contract (the output lives in `build`)
3. publish the app to the **staging** environment.

Sample output:
```sh
 > aragon apm publish major "--environment" "staging"

 ✔ Successfully published app.open.aragonpm.eth v1.0.0: 
 ℹ Contract address: 0xE636bcA5B95e94F749F63E322a04DB59362299F1
 ℹ Content (ipfs): QmR695Wu5KrHNec7pRP3kPvwYihABDAyVYdX5D5vwLgxCn
 ℹ Transaction hash: 0x3d752db29cc106e9ff98b260a90615921eb32471425a29ead8cbb830fb224d8
```

> **Note**<br>
> You can also deploy a major version with only frontend changes by passing `--only-content`. 
> The contract location is defined in `arapp.json` under `path`.

## Minor/patch version: content only

Command:
```sh
npm run publish:patch -- --environment staging
```

This will:
1. _build_ the app's frontend (which lives in `dist`)
2. publish the app to the **staging** environment.

Sample output:
```sh
 ✔ Successfully published app.open.aragonpm.eth v1.1.1: 
 ℹ Contract address: 0xE636bcA5B95e94F749F63E322a04DB59362299F1
 ℹ Content (ipfs): QmUYv9cjyNVxCyAJGK2YXjkbzh6u4iW2ak81Z9obdefM1q
 ℹ Transaction hash: 0x57864d8efd8d439008621b494b19a3e8f876a8a46b38475f9626802f0a1403c2
```

## Check published versions

Command:
```sh
npm run versions -- --environment staging
```

Sample output:
```sh
 ℹ app.open.aragonpm.eth has 4 published versions
 ✔ 1.0.0: 0xE636bcA5B95e94F749F63E322a04DB59362299F1 ipfs:QmR695Wu5KrHNec7pRP3kPvwYihABDAyVYdX5D5vwLgxCn
 ✔ 1.1.0: 0xE636bcA5B95e94F749F63E322a04DB59362299F1 ipfs:QmSwjUZFpv2c2e9fLoxtgFrAsAmBN4DyQGJp4RcqQcW3z3
 ✔ 1.1.1: 0xE636bcA5B95e94F749F63E322a04DB59362299F1 ipfs:QmUYv9cjyNVxCyAJGK2YXjkbzh6u4iW2ak81Z9obdefM1q
 ✔ 2.0.0: 0x74CBbbC932d7C344FCd789Eba24BfD40e52980c9 ipfs:Qmadb3hzwLDKtb93fF367Vg1epkdsLZF4dhpapNYynjgZF
```

## More about environments

The default environments used by aragonCLI are defined in [`environments.default.json`](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/blob/master/packages/aragon-cli/config/environments.default.json). This file has 4 environments:

| Environment       | Network   |
|---                |---        |
| aragon:local      | localhost |
| aragon:rinkeby    | rinkeby   |
| aragon:staging    | rinkeby   |
| aragon:mainnet    | mainnet   |

In case you have an `arapp.json` file in your app directory, aragonCLI will use your local configuration over the default.

> **Note**<br>
> The `aragon:local ` environment which points to `localhost` does not have an ENS Registry address specified because aragonCLI will default the value to `0xB9462EF3441346dBc6E49236Edbb0dF207db09B7` (the ENS Registry pre-deployed on the local development chain).
