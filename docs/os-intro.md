**aragonOS** is a **smart contract framework** for building DAOs, dapps and protocols.

Its architecture is based on the idea of a decentralized organization being the aggregate of multiple components (called applications) and a pillar that is the **Kernel** which governs [how these applications can talk to each other](/docs/acl-intro.html) and how other entities can interact with them.

aragonOS provides the following functionality:
- **Upgreadability**: Smart contracts can be **upgraded to a newer version**. Example: *Fixing a bug or adding a feature*.
- **Permission control**: By using the `auth` and `authP` modifiers you can **protect functionality** so only other apps or entities can access it. Example: *Protecting a vault so only the DAO's Voting app can initiate an action to transfer funds*.
- **Forwarders**: aragonOS apps can send their intent to perform an action to other apps so that **intent is forwarded if a set of requirements are met**. Example: *Withdrawing funds from a vault if a vote passed and a time-lock expired*.

All the above makes it very simple for aragonOS apps to incorporate **governance**. You just need to add a voting app, configure permissions the right way, and you are ready to go!
