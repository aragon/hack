## Text styles

Text styles are used to enhance the information with additional visual attributes that convey meaning such as the font size, line spacing, text alignment, and text colors.


## Vertical Rhythm

To maintain consistency in the vertical rhythm of the text, we will use 24px separations between the titles and the paragraphs. These separations can also be applied at the top and bottom of the blocks.

**CORRECT USE OF COLOR**<br>
The correct use of color will be important when creating our blocks of text. It is essential to never improvise or use random colors, neither in the title, nor in the paragraph.
