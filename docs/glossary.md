### All Aragon terminology
---

- [**aragonCLI**](/docs/cli-usage.html): Tool for creating, testing and publishing Aragon applications.
- [**aragonOS**](/docs/aragonos-intro.html): Framework that enables flexible and upgradeable governance mechanisms by creating and assigning permissions to multiple entities.
- [**aragonPM**](/docs/apm.html): Decentralized package manager based on aragonOS that handles upgreadability of smart contracts and arbitrary data blobs, such as webapps.
- **aragonPM Repository**: Smart contract deployed inside aragonPM that keeps track of the versions for a package.
- **aragonAPI**: Standard set of APIs and specifications used to interact with aragonOS-powered contracts by handling transaction pathing, upgradeability, and contract state. Reference implementations in specific languages:
    - [JavaScript](/docs/aragonjs-ref.html)
- [**aragonUI**](/docs/aragonui-intro.html): Aragon-native toolkit of UI components for decentralized apps.
- [**Aragon client**](http://app.aragon.org): Client to interact with aragonOS-powered decentralized organizations. It implements a signer with transaction pathing, notifications and a sandboxed environment for aragonOS-based apps using aragonAPI.
- **DAO**: Stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Here, a DAO means a set of aragonOS smart contracts.
- [**DAO Kit**](/docs/kits-intro.html): Smart contracts that can be used as templates for creating pre-configured DAOs in just one transaction.
- **aragonID**: aragonID is a lightweight identity system using [ENS](http://ens.domains).
- **Aragen**: Tool that automatically generates everything that is needed to run Aragon on a local Ethereum chain.
- **Aragon apps**: Apps that use aragonOS, aragonAPI, and integrate inside the Aragon client.
- **[Access Control List](/docs/acl-intro.html) (ACL)** The ACL is a mapping of who has permission to execute an action in an Aragon app and who can re-grant or revoke that permission.
