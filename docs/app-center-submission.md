For the time being, we ask that you submit an [issue to the `aragon/aragon` repo](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/issues/new/choose) with the following:

- Name of your application
- Link to its development repo
- Link to an organization with the application installed
- Current development status
- Short summary explaining what the application does

Please double check that your app includes the relevant assets and that they are in the correct formats ([see guide](/docs/app-center-preparing-assets)).

#####

We will update this page accordingly as we build more community-governed infrastructure for curating apps in the future.
